# ccglass

**See exactly what your coding agent sends to the model.** A zero-dependency
local logging reverse-proxy + web dashboard for **Claude Code, Codex,
DeepSeek-TUI, and Kimi**.
One command, like `ollama`:

```bash
npm install -g ccglass
ccglass
```

Run with no arguments and `ccglass` asks which client to inspect:

```
  Which client do you want to inspect?

    1) Claude Code
    2) Codex (OpenAI)
    3) DeepSeek-TUI
    4) Kimi (Moonshot, via Claude Code)

  >
```

Or name it directly: `ccglass claude`, `ccglass codex`, `ccglass deepseek`,
`ccglass deepseek-tui`, or `ccglass kimi`.

`ccglass` starts a proxy, points the client at it via the right base-URL env var,
launches it for you, and opens a dashboard where you watch every request in real
time — the full system prompt, every tool schema, the message history,
token/cache/cost numbers, and a turn-to-turn diff.

```
  ● ccglass watching Codex (OpenAI) → https://api.openai.com
    dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:57633
```

## Why

These CLIs are Node/native apps that **ignore `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`** — so
Charles/mitmproxy never see the traffic, and `fetch`-patching tools break across
updates. `ccglass` sidesteps all of it: the client does the HTTPS to the real API
itself; you only intercept the plain HTTP hop to localhost. No CA certs, no TLS
pinning.

## Supported clients

| `ccglass <client>` | Wraps | Env var | Upstream | Format |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `claude` | Claude Code | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | api.anthropic.com | Anthropic Messages |
| `codex` | Codex | `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | api.openai.com | OpenAI Responses / Chat |
| `deepseek` | DeepSeek-TUI dispatcher | `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` | api.deepseek.com | OpenAI Chat |
| `deepseek-tui` | DeepSeek-TUI runtime | `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` | api.deepseek.com | OpenAI Chat |
| `kimi` | Claude Code → Moonshot | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | api.moonshot.ai/anthropic | Anthropic Messages |
| `run --provider <p> -- <cmd>` | any client | per provider | per provider | per provider |

Kimi runs through Claude Code against Moonshot's Anthropic-compatible endpoint —
make sure your Moonshot key is set (`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`).
DeepSeek-TUI uses its OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint — make sure
your DeepSeek key is set (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`).

## What you get

- **Live request stream** — every call appears instantly; click to expand the
  system prompt, messages, and tools with all escaped strings unescaped.
- **Turn-to-turn diff** — pick two requests, see exactly what context was added
  this turn and which blocks carry a cache breakpoint.
- **Token / cache / cost** — exact input/output/cache tokens from the response
  `usage`, cache-hit rate, and estimated USD per request (per-provider pricing).
- **Response reassembly + export** — streamed SSE rebuilt into the final message
  (`stop_reason`, tool calls, usage), for both the Anthropic and OpenAI wire
  formats; export any request to Markdown / JSON / HAR.

## Usage

```bash
ccglass                       # pick a client interactively
ccglass claude [args...]      # inspect Claude Code (args pass through, e.g. --resume)
ccglass codex  [args...]      # inspect Codex
ccglass deepseek [args...]    # inspect DeepSeek-TUI (dispatcher)
ccglass deepseek-tui [args...] # inspect DeepSeek-TUI runtime directly
ccglass kimi   [args...]      # inspect Kimi (via Claude Code)
ccglass run --provider openai -- <cmd...>   # inspect any client
ccglass view                  # re-open the dashboard over saved .ccglass/ logs
ccglass export <id> --format md|json|har
```

### Options

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--provider <p>` | from command | Force format/env for `run` (`claude`/`codex`/`deepseek`/`kimi`/`openai`) |
| `--upstream <url>` | per provider | Override the upstream API |
| `--port <n>` | auto | Dashboard port |
| `--proxy-port <n>` | auto | Proxy port |
| `--dir <path>` | `./.ccglass` | Where logs are stored |
| `--open` | off | Open the dashboard in your browser |
| `--no-redact` | off | Keep auth tokens unmasked in saved logs |

## Logs & secrets

Captures are written to `./.ccglass/<session>/NNNN.json`. Auth tokens
(`authorization`, `x-api-key`) are **masked by default** — pass `--no-redact`
to keep them. Treat the log directory as sensitive regardless.

## Requirements

Node ≥ 18. No runtime dependencies.

## Acknowledgments

Heartfelt thanks to **庄表伟 ([@zhuangbiaowei](https://github.com/zhuangbiaowei))** for
contributing **first-class DeepSeek-TUI support** ([#1](https://github.com/jianshuo/ccglass/pull/1)).

DeepSeek-TUI ships as a dual-binary coding agent — a `deepseek` dispatcher and a
`deepseek-tui` runtime. 庄表伟 wired up both as native ccglass providers, pointing
them at the proxy via `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` and reusing the existing
OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions adapter, so every DeepSeek request now shows up
in the dashboard with zero extra setup. The contribution also added them to the
interactive picker, documented usage across the README, and shipped provider
regression tests to keep it working. Thank you for making ccglass better for the
whole DeepSeek community. 🙏
